# Analysis of Sleeping Barber Problem Solution

## 1. Main Synchronization Components

### Data Structures and Synchronization Mechanisms:
- `Queue waiting_customers`: Bounded queue (MAX_CHAIRS = 3) to manage waiting customers
- `Event barber_ready`: Event to signal barber readiness
- `Event customer_ready`: Event to signal customer arrival
- `Lock mutex`: Lock for synchronizing access to shared resources

### Main Threads:
- Barber thread
- Customer threads
- Shop controller thread
- Closing checker thread
- Input handler thread

## 2. Solving Synchronization Issues

### 2.1. Race Condition
Code addresses race conditions through:
- Using mutex lock when adding customers to the queue:
```python
with mutex:
    if waiting_customers.full():
        # handle full seats scenario
    waiting_customers.put(customer_id)
```
- Using thread-safe Queue to manage waiting customers list
- State variables protected by mutex

### 2.2. Deadlock Prevention
Code prevents deadlock by:
- Using timeout in waiting for customers:
```python
customer_ready.wait(timeout=1)
```
- No circular waiting: resources allocated in order
- Barber can exit waiting state if shop closes

### 2.3. Resource Starvation
Addresses starvation through:
- Using FIFO Queue ensuring customers are served in arrival order
- Limited waiting seats (MAX_CHAIRS = 3) to prevent excessive waiting
- Auto-closing mechanism after 4 seconds without new customers

## 3. Main Processing Flow

### Barber Flow:
1. Check for customers in queue
2. If no customers:
   - Print sleeping message
   - Wait for customer signal (with timeout)
3. If customers present:
   - Get customer from queue
   - Perform haircut (sleep random 3-6s)
   - Complete and notify

### Customer Flow:
1. Check if shop is open
2. Check and add to queue (with mutex)
3. Signal barber about new customer
4. Leave if no seats available

## 4. Safe Closing Mechanism
- Automatic closing check after 4s without customers
- Manual closing allowed with 'q' key
- Wait for all queued customers to be served before complete closure

## 5. Solution Advantages
1. Thread-safe: Proper use of synchronization mechanisms
2. No deadlock: Implements timeout and safe exit
3. Fair scheduling: FIFO queue for customers
4. Resource efficient: Limited waiting seats
5. Graceful shutdown: Safe closure and complete customer service

## 6. Key Implementation Features

### Thread Synchronization:
```python
def barber(barber_id):
    while program_running or not waiting_customers.empty():
        if waiting_customers.empty():
            customer_ready.wait(timeout=1)
            # Prevents deadlock with timeout
```

### Resource Management:
```python
def customer(customer_id):
    with mutex:
        if waiting_customers.full():
            # Handles resource limits
            return
        waiting_customers.put(customer_id)
```

### Safe Shutdown:
```python
def check_closing_conditions():
    if current_time - last_customer_time > 4 and waiting_customers.empty():
        program_running = False
        customer_ready.set()  # Wake barber for shutdown
```

## 7. Critical Sections Protection

The code implements critical section protection through:
1. Mutex locks for queue access
2. Thread-safe Queue implementation
3. Event synchronization for barber-customer interaction
4. Atomic operations for state changes
5. Proper resource release in all scenarios

## 8. Performance Considerations
1. Limited queue size prevents system overload
2. Timeout mechanisms prevent indefinite waiting
3. Event-based synchronization reduces CPU usage
4. FIFO ordering ensures fair service
5. Graceful shutdown preserves system integrity
